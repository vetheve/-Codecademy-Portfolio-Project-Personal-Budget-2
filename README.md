# Codecademy Portfolio Project Personal Budget-2
**Codecademy Back-End Engineer Career Path includes a portfolio project component.**

In this project, you will extend the Personal Budget API created in Personal Budget, Part I. In the first Budget API, we did not have a way to persist data on the server. Now, we are going to build out a persistence layer (aka a database or DB) to keep track of the budget envelopes and their balances. You will need to plan out your database design, then use PostgreSQL to create the necessary tables. Once your database is set up, connect your API calls to a database. Once youâ€™ve added and connected your database, you will add a new feature to your server that allows users to enter transactions. This feature will put your envelope system into action! Finally, you will make your API available for others to use by documenting it with Swagger and deploying it with Heroku.

## Project Objectives:

- Use Git version control
- Create documentation using the Swagger API
- Implement a database
- Integrate existing API endpoints with database layer
- Database implementation for transactions
- Deploy the app using Heroku

## Prerequisites:

- Command-line and file navigation
- Git and GitHub
- Javascript
- Node.js/Express
- Postman
- PostgreSQL
- Database relationships and configuration
